# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

## RSS feeds source

Currently it is possible to read the RSS feeds from the following sites:
* [Udacity Blog](http://blog.udacity.com/feed)
* [CSS Tricks](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CssTricks)
* [HTML5 Rocks](http://feeds.feedburner.com/html5rocks)
* [Linear Digressions](http://feeds.feedburner.com/udacity-linear-digressions)

## Running the application

After opening the page you will see the RSS feeds from the first source - [Udacity Blog](http://blog.udacity.com/feed). You can change the source by opening the menu and selecting any of the other sites.

## Tests

Under the RSS feeds you will see the results of the test suite. If everything is fine they all should be 'green'.
